# Cryptanalysis-of-primitive-ciphers
## In this assignment the goal was to get familiar with primitive ciphers in cryptanalysis.
Task 1 was about cracking a poly-alphabetic cipher, while in task 2, we would get
familiar with the simplified version of the DES algorithm. In Task 1 I managed to
decipher the cipher, calculate execution times for different key lengths and I did not
manage to decipher the last cipher with the same tools as I did the first. In task 2 I
deciphered both tables with SDES and TripleSDES, but I did not manage to do task
3 and 4 on part 2.
